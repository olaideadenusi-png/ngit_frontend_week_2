Project Description & Most Useful Tags

Project Description:
I created a personal portfolio webpage that introduces me as an aspiring frontend developer. The page includes my name, professional title, a profile picture, a brief bio about my goals, a list of my current skills, and my hobbies. This is a foundational portfolio page that showcases what I've learned in HTML and presents my information in a structured, organized way.

Most Useful Tags:

<h1 to h6> create different sized headings (h1 is biggest, h6 is smallest)

<img> - This tag allowed me to add my profile picture and display it. The width and height attributes helped me control the image size.

<ul> and <li> - These list tags were perfect for displaying my skills and hobbies in a clean, organized bullet-point format that's easy to see.

<p> - The paragraph tag helped me write my bio description in a proper text format, making it readable.

<br> - This simple tag gave me control over spacing, allowing me to add a break to my code

<src="image/Elite pics.jpeg"> - tells the browser where to find the image file
<width:200px; height:200px>- makes the image 200 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall (square shape)
<border-radius:50%> - rounds the corners completely to make the square image into a perfect circle. the shape of the border is dependent on the persentage
<border:10px solid purple> - adds a thick 10-pixel purple border around the circular image

These tags formed the foundation of my first portfolio page and helped me understand how HTML structures content on the web.
